    "**ECDSA** does the same thing as any other **digital signing signature**, but more efficiently. it is used to create **ECDSA certificates** which is a type of electronic document used for **authentication** of the owner of the certificate, information about the owner of the certificate, and the signature of the issuer of the certificate, who is a verified trusted entity.\n",

    "Lots of operations will be done on this curve for the encryption like the **Elliptic curve point multiplication** which is the operation of successively adding a point along an elliptic curve to itself repeatedly. It is used in **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** as a means of producing a one-way function.\n",
